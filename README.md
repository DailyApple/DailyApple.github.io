# DailyAppleAPI :apple::stethoscope:	

## Background :book:
DailyApple is an application that allows users to collect their daily biometric data using a bluetooth device to better assist their health care providers.  This data will be used with (doctor suite name?) to show daily trends in patient health so that a higher level of care can be given.  Both negative and positive trends can be identified and utilized to aid both the doctor and the patient in care quality.

## Overview :eyeglasses:
we choose to create a software system that aids users in collecting their daily biometric data. 
The goal of this application is to help patients and doctors better guage where patients stand according to their daily health data, 
and how this data can be used to improve the health of the patients. 
DailyApple will take user's biometric data from bluetooth devices, store and compile that data
so that it can be displayed and referenced to allow medical providers to assess patient health. 
DailyApple is not only a great tool for keeping track of health progress, 
The more data that is collected by the system, the better a health care provider will be able to aid them in their health goals.
For example, if the patient shows either positive or negative trends in the collected biometric data the better
a doctor is able to provide an accurate assessment of care needs for that patient.
